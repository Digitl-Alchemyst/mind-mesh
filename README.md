## Configuration

### Option 1. Set up the project locally

[Clone/Fork the repository](https://github.com/Digitl-Alchemyst/next-alchemy-14.2)

Rename.env.example to .env.local and populate the variables with the correct information from the above services. Alternatively, you can populate the env variables in the Vercel Dashboard and use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) to pull the environment variables from your Vercel project.

#### Step 3.5v1. Create the .env file locally and populate in Vercel

Deploy to your testing enviroment on Vercel

```bash
npx vercel
```

The first build will fail with no env variables. Open your Vercel dashboard and copy the entire .env file and paste it in the first line of the Vercel env variable settings and redeploy the project

```bash
npx vercel
```

### Step 3.5v2. Download the environment variables from Vercel to your local environment:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

### Step 3. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

When you run this development server, the changes you make in your frontend and backend configuration will be applied live using hot reloading.

Your personal website should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000][localhost-3000]!

### Step 4. Deploy to production

To deploy your changes to production using `git`:

```bash
git add .
git commit
git push
```

Alternatively, you can deploy without a `git` hosting provider using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

### Testing, Formatting, Linting, and Commits

Run ESLint

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run ESLint with fixes

```bash
npm run lint --fix
```

Check code for formatting inconsistencies with Prettier

```bash
prettier --check.
```

Format code to project standards with Prettier

```bash
prettier --write.
```

Run Test with Jest & React Testing Library

```bash
npm jest
```

Run Jest in Verbose Mode

```bash
npm jest --verbose --watch
```

Run Jest with Coverage

```bash
npm jest --coverage
```

Run Jest in CI Mode

```bash
npm jest --ci
```
